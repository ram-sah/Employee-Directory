## Description: 

An Employee Directory App with React. This app utilizes an API to populate random users and then create a directory. Users can search for employees by "name" and also organize each field (Name, LastName, PhoneNumber, Email, DOB) in ascending or descending order.
This application helps user to view their entire employee directory at once so that they can have quick access to their information.
